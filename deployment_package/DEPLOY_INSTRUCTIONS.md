# Simple Deployment Guide

1.  **Open cPanel File Manager**.
2.  **Go to the `public_html` folder**.
3.  **Upload** everything inside the `deployment_package/public_html` folder to there.
4.  **Confirm**: Make sure you see `.htaccess` in the list (you might need to enable "Show Hidden Files" in Settings).

**That's it! Your site is live.**
